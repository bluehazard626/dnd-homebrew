    applicable:
      - Any Weapon
    cost: 675
    description: |
      This weapon is tied to a pocket dimension hidden on another plane and can
      be recalled as a Bonus Action to appear in your hand, or sent away as a
      free action while it dissipates into shadows and disappears from your hands. 
      
      When freshly reclaimed, the next attack with this weapon has +1 to attack and Damage rolls.
      
      To reclaim a banished weapon, a small portal of shadows, no larger than 2 feet
      in diameter opens inches away from your open palmed hand for you to reach in
      and claim it. The portal only allows for the bounded object to be placed inside
      of it. (Can’t have a hollow hammer enchanted with this to store things inside it.) 
      
      A Banished weapon cannot be sent away and summoned within the same round.
      
  - name: Chill
    type: weapon
    applicable:
      - Any Weapon
    cost: 625
    description: |
      This weapon is imbued with the power to chill itself to temperatures so low they could
      almost cause frostbite.
      
      When activated, the next successful attack performed with this weapon does an extra 1d8
      cold damage, and an extra +1d4 cold damage for each time they are struck with this ability
      within 5 minutes (1st = 1d8, 2nd =1d8+1d4, 3rd = 1d8+2d4) and if an enemy is hit by 3
      charges, they must succeed on a DC 10+ Half Character Lvl Constitution Saving Throw or
      become frozen (immobilized) until the start of its next turn.
      
      The weapon stores 5 charges of this ability at a time, and requires 1 hour to recover 1
      charge. Alternatively, 3 charges can be expelled to create magical glaciers occupying a
      15' cube cast ub front of the caster that lasts for 2 turns ending on the casters turn.
      Those who start their turn in the glaciers take 1d8 cold damage, and are in difficult terrain.
      Entering the glaciers for the first time also causes 1d8 cold damage.  Getting hit by
      the glacier adds one stack of Chill per encounter. The glaciers magically evaporate away
      at the end of their time.
      
      Activating any amount of charges is a free action.

    description: |
      Within this weapon is a raging core of water constantly in motion and sending a torrent
      of water along the edges of it whenever it is unsheathed.
      
      Two times per encounter as a standard action, you can loose the water inside the weapon
      to create an extension of water to whip at a creature. When using this effect, your
      weapon can reach an extra 5 feet but deals your Weapon Damage dice + Proficiency Bonus
      bludgeoning damage. As a constantly moving torrent, the water retreats back into the
      weapon at the end of your turn.
      
      As a bonus action, you can boil or chill the water to alter the damage caused by the
      water whip to become fire or cold damage for one hour. This cannot be changed again
      until after a chosen damage type has been in effect for the hour.
      
      Once per day, as a standard action you can blast a creature within 5 feet with a flood
      of water. They must succeed on a DC 12+Proficiency bonus Strength Saving throw or take
      2d6 force damage and be pushed 1d4 squares away from the caster. On a save, the creature
      takes half damage and is not pushed away.

      Ammunition expelled from this weapon can become charmed with arcane energy when
      channeled. When you expel a charge, the next shot you land with this weapon will
      have 1 of 3 effects of your choice:

      1. All creatures within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 10+Proficiency bonus
      Strength Saving Throw or be pushed 5 feet away from the target

      2. All creatures within 5 feet of the target including the target must succeed on a DC
      8+Proficiency bonus Dexterity Saving throw or be pulled towards the floor by a
      force effect, making them prone

      3.The targeted creature has a singularity placed on it, creating a pulling effect
      on itself that travels with them, harming it for 2 force damage for 1d6 turns.
      While the pulling effect lingers on the target, ranged attacks against the creature
      gain a +1 to attack rolls per singularity placed on it.

      The weapon stores 5 charges of this ability at a time, and requires 1 hour to
      recover 1 charge.

      Alternatively, all 5 charges can be expelled to create a giant singularity at a
      point within range for 1d6 turns. The singularity istelf does not occupy the
      space it is in. All creatures within 10 feet of the singularity must
      succeed on a DC 12+Proficiency bonus Strength saving throw or have their speed
      reduced to 0 and be pulled to within 5 feet of the singularity if there is room to.
      An affected creature can make another Strength Saving Throw at the end of their
      turns to resist the singularity. All creatures that end their turn within 5' of
      the singularity take 1d4 force damage.

      if it is within 10’ of you as a bonus action.

      The weapon or implement will take the path of least resistance to return to its owner but cannot
      move if more than 5 lbs is holding it in place.

      During its return, if it collides with a creature, it will only inflict 1 damage if
      it is slashing or bludgeoning weapon.

      If it is a piercing weapon and collides with a creature on its return, roll an attack
      roll against that creature without your proficiency or attack modifiers, on a hit it
      inflicts a weapon die of damage and is stuck in the creature at their location.
      
      Implements simply move past creatures. any creature can use their Reaction to try and grab
      the returning Implement at a Dexterity Check of DC 10+Proficiency Bonus.

      Though you cannot recall a held or restrained weapon or implement, it will try to move towards you
      with the little strength it offers. The weapon can exert as much force as how much it
      weighs.

      suspended state. It is not prone to being used in a thrown or dropped capacity, as if it were to
      be used in either action, it would stop moving as soon as it was released. 

      (Examples: It is set by a person onto a table and the table falls out from under it, it would stay.
      If disarmed by a creature in combat it would not drop to the floor but rather remain in your
      immedient location midair. If held out and released it would float, but if you were to press on
      it to climb it your hand would immediately push it down with no resistance.)
