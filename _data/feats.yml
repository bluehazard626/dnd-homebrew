      When you cast a spell that restores Hit Points, before rolling the die you can roll a
      percentage die for each die that you would roll. If the result is greater than or equal
      to 50 you heal the maximum amount for that die. If the result is less than 50 roll 
      the die as normal. You must finish a long rest before using Blessed Heal again.
