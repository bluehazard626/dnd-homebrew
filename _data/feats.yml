    description: |
      When you cast a spell that restores Hit Points, before
      rolling the die you can roll a percentage die for each die
      that you would roll. If the result is freater than or equal to
      50, you heal the maximum amount for that die.
      If the result is less than 50, roll the die as normal.
      You must dinish a long rest before using Blessed Heal again.
