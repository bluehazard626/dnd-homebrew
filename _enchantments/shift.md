This enchantment allows a weapons primary material to shift to the properties of another.

Once per day, you can change the primary material of your weapon to Steel, Iron, Silver, Stone, Wood, or Copper until your next long rest. The material density will change so that the weight will remain the same no matter which is chosen.

You must complete a long rest before you can change the material again.
