An item with this enchantment will remain frozen in space when nothing is touching it. It it considered weightless and offers no surface for physical deflection or support if it is in its suspended state. It is not prone to being used in a thrown or dropped capacity, as if it were to be used in either action, it would stop moving as soon as it was released. 

(Examples: It is set by a person onto a table and the table falls out from under it, it would stay. If disarmed by a creature in combat it would not drop to the floor but rather remain in your immedient location midair. If held out and released it would float, but if you were to press on it to climb it your hand would immediately push it down with no resistance.)
