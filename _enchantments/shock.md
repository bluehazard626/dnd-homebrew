This weapon is imbued with the power of lightning and grants you swift movement and action.

When activated, you are granted +1 to attack rolls until the end of your turn, and add 1d4 lightning damage to attacks with the enchanted weapon. You are also granted the ability to use your bonus action to make an extra attack with the enchanted weapon.

The weapon stores 5 charges of this ability at a time, and requires a short rest to recover 1 charge.

Alternatively, 3 charges can be expelled to cast a small chain lightning spell that hits 2d4 targets for 2d4 lightning damage. Targets must be within 5â€™ of each other to be chained and the lightning cannot double back. Add 2d4 damage if they are wearing armor made of metal.

Activating any amount of charges is a free action.
