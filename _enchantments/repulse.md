While wielding a shield with this enchantment, you can attempt to send back a portion of a ranged spell attack cast against you.

When you are the target of a ranged spell attack and it doesnâ€™t break your AC, you can use your reaction to roll a DC 12+Spell level Constitution Check to try and send half the damage you would have received back to the caster.

The attack roll they made against you is what is used to determine if it breaks their AC or not.

This effect does not work for AOE magic attacks.
