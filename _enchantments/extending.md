While wielding a shield with this enchantment, 2x per day a wall of force can be extended out to protect an adjacent ally as a reaction. This must be activated before damage from the attack on the adjacent ally is rolled.

The wall of force gives +3 to AC against physical attacks and +4 to magical.
