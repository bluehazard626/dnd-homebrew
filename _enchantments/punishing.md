Armor enchanted with this becomes sharpened at the corners with mithril spikes.

When a melee attack within 5â€™ misses its intended target, Spikes from your armor leech out to stab the attacker. You can use your reaction to make an attack roll with half your AC added to your attack modifier. On a hit, it deals 1d4+1 piercing damage for light armor, and 1d8+1 for medium armor. Creatures hit with these spikes have disadvantage on attack rolls until they spend a full action removing the spikes from themselves.

This can be used once per 2 character lvls  per day.
