This weapon is imbued with the power to chill itself to temperatures so low they could almost cause frostbite. When activated, the next successful attack performed with this weapon does an extra 1d8 cold damage, and an extra +1d4 cold damage for each time they are struck with this ability within 5 minutes (1st = 1d8, 2nd =1d8+1d4, 3rd = 1d8+2d4) and if an enemy is hit by 3 charges, they must succeed on a DC 10+ Half Character Lvl Constitution Saving Throw or become frozen (immobilized) until the start of its next turn.

The weapon stores 5 charges of this ability at a time, and requires 1 hour to recover 1 charge.

Alternatively, 3 charges can be expelled to create a 15â€™ cube in front of the caster of magical glaciers for 2 rounds that spawn from slamming into the ground. Those who start their turn in the glaciers take 1d8 cold damage, and are in difficult terrain. Entering the glaciers for the first time also causes 1d8 cold damage.  Getting hit by the glacier adds one stack of Chill per encounter The glaciers magically evaporate away at the end of their time.

Activating any amount of charges is a free action.
