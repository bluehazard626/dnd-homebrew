This weapon is tied to a pocket dimension hidden on another plane and can be recalled as a Bonus Action to appear in your hand, or sent away as a free action while it dissipates into shadows and disappears from your hands.

When freshly reclaimed, the next attack with this weapon has +1 to attack and Damage rolls.

To reclaim a banished weapon, a small portal of shadows, no larger than 2’ in diameter opens inches away from your open palmed hand for you to reach in and claim it. The portal only allows for the bounded object to be placed inside of it. (Can’t have a hollow hammer enchanted with this to store things inside it.)

A Banished weapon cannot be sent away and summoned within the same round.
