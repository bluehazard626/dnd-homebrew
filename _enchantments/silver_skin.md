While worn, armor with this enchantment releases a fine mystical silver powder over the wearer, causing them to shine slightly.

If a creature who attacks this wearer within 5 feet is weak to silvered weapons, they take 1d6 radiant damage on a miss against the wearer, and 2d6 if they hit the wearer.
