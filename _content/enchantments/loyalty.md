Any weapon enchanted with Loyalty can be recalled to your hand by saying “Return” if it is within 10’ of you as a bonus action.

The weapon will take the path of least resistance to return to its owner but cannot move if more than 5 lbs is holding it in place.

During its return, if it collides with a creature, it will only inflict 1 damage if it is slashing or bludgeoning.

If it is a piercing weapon and collides with a creature on its return, roll an attack roll against that creature without your proficiency or attack modifiers, on a hit it inflicts a weapon die of damage and is stuck in the creature at their location.

Though you cannot recall a held or restrained weapon, it will try to move towards you with the little strength it offers. The weapon can exert as much force as how much it weighs
