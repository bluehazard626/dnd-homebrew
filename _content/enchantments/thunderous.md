This weapon is imbued with the power of thunder and grants you the ability to push foes with your blows.

When activated, this weapon adds 1d4 thunder damage to attacks with it until the end of your turn.

Each creature hit with this weapon must make a DC 14 strength saving throw or be pushed back 5 feet for every 5 hit points of damage done. If a target is slammed into a wall or obstacle that would stop their movement, they take another 1d4 bludgeoning damage. If that obstacle is another creature, that creature must make a DC 14 strength saving throw or take the same amount of bludgeoning damage.

The weapon stores 5 charges of this ability at a time, and requires 1 hour to recover 1 charge.

Alternatively, 2 charges can be expelled to grant your next strike a 15’ cone shaped version of Thunderwave, cast from your position. Creatures within range need to succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or suffer 1d8 thunder damage and be pushed back 10’ and knocked prone. On a successful save they take half damage and are not pushed back or knocked prone.

Activating any amount of charges is a free action.
