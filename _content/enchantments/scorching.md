This weapon is imbued with the power to ignite itself with a magical fire that does no harm to the wielder nor itself.

When ignited, the next successful attack performed with this weapon does an extra 1d8 fire damage and if the target fails a DC 12 Dexterity save, catch fire (1d8 at the start of their turn and can attempt the save at the end of their turns).

The weapon stores 5 charges of this ability at a time, and requires 1 hour to recover 1 charge.

Alternatively, 3 charges can be expelled to throw a concentrated fire bolt for 2d10 fire damage up to 15â€™.

Activating any amount of charges is a free action.
