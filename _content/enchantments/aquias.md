Armor enchanted with this acts normal until in or near water. Once submerged, it gains magical scales that lays atop the metal and fins and ethereal webbing sprout along it.

While wearing heavy armor with the Aquias trait while up to at least the neck line from the feet in water, it is treated as light armor and offers a +3 on Athletic checks. Furthermore, your movement speed is increased by 15’ and you can jump up to 5’ straight up from the water.

If you are within 30’ of a body of water of at least a 5x5x2 squares, the armor gains 5’ of movement speed, a +1 to athletic checks, and the armor counts as medium armor.
