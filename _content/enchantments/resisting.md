The weaving of clothes with this enchantment tighten to a magical degree and become smooth beyond belief.

When hit by an effect that acts as splash damage, you can make a Dexterity save with a DC of 9+ the attackers spellcasting ability modifier to brace your clothing and reduce the damage you would normally receive to half.

You still make any normal saves the effect would have you make to determine damage calculation.
